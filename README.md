This project implements a full Triple DES (3DES) encryption and decryption system using VHDL for FPGA deployment. The design is built around a modular and reusable DES core, expanded into a secure EDE (Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt) or DED (Decrypt-Encrypt-Decrypt) configuration.

A reference C implementation is also provided.
